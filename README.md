Analysis Questions in Part 2:
How many months exist on Mars?
The data set contains measurements from 12 Martian months, and indicated by the value counts of measurements organized by month.

How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of day exist in the scraped dataset?
Since sol represents the number of elapsed Martian days, subtracting the minimum sol value from the maximum sol value indicates there are 1967 Martian days worth of data in the dataset.

What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?
Month 3 is the coldest, and Month 8 is the warmest.

Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
Month 9 has the highest atmospheric pressure, and Month 6 has the lowest.

About how many terrestrial(Earth) days exist in a Martian year?
The distance from peak to peak of the Minimum Temperature vs. Terrestrial Days plot is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot.
